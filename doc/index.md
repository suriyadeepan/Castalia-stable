This post will serve as a step 0 for Castalia beginners. Since Castalia is an Omnetpp based framework, the first step is to install Omnetpp. This guide will help you do that. Follow this guide for downloading and building Castalia. Once you have successfully installed it, next thing to do is to open up the Castalia Manual and spend time reading through, until you get bored. This will give you a good idea about the architecture and basic usage of scripts in Castalia.
