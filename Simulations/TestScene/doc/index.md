# Start here

I have spent the last six weeks waywardly, doing random things. The vacation is over now and I have to return back to my research work. I'm going to wet my toes by writing a series of posts on Castalia, a BAN/WSN simulation framework. This post will serve as a step 0 for Castalia beginners.

Castalia is an Omnetpp based framework, so, the first step is to install Omnetpp. This guide will help you do that. Follow this guide for downloading and building Castalia. Once you have successfully installed it, next thing to do is to open up the Castalia Manual and spend time reading through, until you get bored. This will give you a good idea about the architecture and basic usage of scripts in Castalia.
